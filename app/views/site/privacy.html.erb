      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Blogcastr Inc. (“Blogcastr”) operates a live blogging web service at Blogcastr.com. It is Blogcastr’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.</p>
      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>Like most website operators, Blogcastr collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Blogcastr’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Blogcastr’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Blogcastr may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
      <p>Blogcastr also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Blogcastr does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>Certain visitors to Blogcastr’s website choose to interact with Blogcastr in ways that require Blogcastr to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Blogcastr gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for Blogcastr to provide their name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, e.g. your name and username, is listed publically on our Service and is viewable from your profile page and in search results. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
      <p>You should also be aware that other information such as blogcasts, comments, likes, subscriptions, and subscribers are all made publically available and are instantly disseminated. This information may be searchable by a variety of search engines and does not require registration with our Service to view. Other users may share this information using third-party services that are integrated with Blogcastr, such as Facebook or Twitter.</p>
      <p>Users can also provided additional information such as a short biography, location, picture, or background image. Like blogcasts and comments, this information is publically disseminated.</p>
      <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
      <p>Blogcastr may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Blogcastr may monitor the most popular blogs on the Blogcastr site. Blogcastr may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Blogcastr does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
      <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>Blogcastr discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Blogcastr’s behalf or to provide services available at Blogcastr’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Blogcastr’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Blogcastr will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.</p> 
      <p>Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations or as described above, Blogcastr discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Blogcastr believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Blogcastr, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Blogcastr and have supplied your email address, Blogcastr may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Blogcastr and our products. We primarily use Blogcastr.com and our own blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Blogcastr takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Blogcastr uses cookies to help Blogcastr identify and track visitors, their usage of Blogcastr website, and their website access preferences. Blogcastr visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Blogcastr’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Blogcastr’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
      <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Blogcastr may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Blogcastr’s sole discretion. Blogcastr encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a Blogcastr.com account, you should also check your Message Inbox for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
