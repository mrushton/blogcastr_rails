= memcache-client

A ruby library for accessing memcached.

Source:

http://github.com/mperham/memcache-client

== Installing memcache-client

Just install the gem:

  $ sudo gem install memcache-client

== Using memcache-client

With one server:

  CACHE = MemCache.new 'localhost:11211'

Or with multiple servers:

  CACHE = MemCache.new %w[one.example.com:11211 two.example.com:11211]


== Tuning memcache-client

The MemCache.new method takes a number of options which can be useful at times.  Please
read the source comments there for an overview.  If you are using Ruby 1.8.x and using
multiple memcached servers, you should install the RubyInline gem for ultimate performance.


== Using memcache-client with Rails

Rails 2.1+ includes memcache-client 1.5.0 out of the box.  See ActiveSupport::Cache::MemCacheStore
and the Rails.cache method for more details.  Rails 2.3+ will use the latest memcache-client
gem installed.
